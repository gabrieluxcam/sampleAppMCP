### **3. UXCam Dashboard Verification**

1. **Open UXCam Dashboard** → Events section
2. **Filter by custom events**:
   - Look for events with `Premium_`, `Milestone_`, `Achievement_` prefixes
   - Verify events have meaningful properties
3. **Check event timing** aligns with session replays
4. **Verify event properties** show business context

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**Problem**: Events not appearing in dashboard
**Solution**: 
- Check console for event validation warnings
- Verify UXCam initialization happens before event logging
- Ensure proper event name formatting (PascalCase)

**Problem**: Event properties empty or wrong type
**Solution**:
- Use String or NSNumber types only
- Check property count doesn't exceed 20
- Verify properties aren't nil when logged

**Problem**: Too many duplicate events
**Solution**:
- Review event timing in user flows
- Consider consolidating similar events with properties
- Use debouncing for rapid user interactions

### **Debug Mode Validation**

Enable debug logging to see detailed event information:

```swift
#if DEBUG
// Events will show validation warnings and success logs
// "📊 Event tracked: Premium_Upgrade_Started with 6 properties"
// "⚠️ Event 'Example' has 21 properties (max: 20)"
#endif
```
